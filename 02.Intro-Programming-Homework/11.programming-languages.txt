Problem 11.Programming Languages
1. Java
Java is a class-bassed, object oriented programming language.
Java and C# are similar programming languages that are statically, strongly,
and manifestly typed, both are class-based object-oriented, both are designed with 
semi-interpretation or runtime compilation in mind, both use garbage-collection.
2. PHP 
PHP is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited 
for Web development and can be embedded into HTML. 
3. c++
C++ was designed to be a low-level platform-neutral object-oriented programming language. 
C# was designed to be a somewhat higher-level component-oriented language. C# is a simple, modern, 
object oriented, and type-safe programming language derived from C and C++. C# 
is firmly planted in the C and C++ family tree of languages, and will immediately 
be familiar to C and C++ programmers.
4. JavaScript
JavaScript is a client and server-side scripting language developed by Netscape that derives much of 
its syntax from C. It can be used across multiple web browsers and is considered essential for developing 
interactive or animated web functions. It is also used in game development and writing desktop applications.
C# and javascript are two completely different things and they work in completely separate domains.
Javascript works on the browser and C# works on the server (in asp.net websites/web apps). 
They work together and neither is better than the other.
5. C
C is general-purpose, imperative programming language developed in the early '70s, 
C is the oldest and most widely used language, providing the building blocks for other popular languages,
such as C#, Java, JavaScript and Python. It is mostly used for creating operating systems, 
hardware drivers and embedded devices, for close work with the hardware.
